# CryptoChallenge

This is a "capture-the-flag"-like challenge with a problem resulting from the un-safe use of cryptographic primitives. The technical background needed to solve the challenge can be found in the document Challenge02TechBackground.pdf, a set of hints to solve the challenge in Challenge02Hints.pdf.

The folder DockerContainer contains the code to build the Docker container, that provides the API that is used in the challenge.

Have fun!
